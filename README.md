# End-to-End-Retail-Intelligence-Platform

# Retail Analytics Demo 🚀

An end-to-end **business intelligence and machine learning pipeline** that simulates a retail company’s workflow — from **data cleaning** and **EDA** to **forecasting, anomaly detection, segmentation, and recommendation analysis**.  
This project demonstrates how to build a full analytics solution and can be used as a reference or learning project.

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```


4️⃣ Run the Scripts
```
Example:
python 01_data_loading_cleaning.py
```


5️⃣ Launch the App
```
streamlit run app/main.py
```
